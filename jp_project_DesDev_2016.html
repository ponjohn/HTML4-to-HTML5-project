Design & Development objective was to convert customer's webpage developed
by Dreamweaver HTML4 into Html5.



Started the project by:
* spent time looking at the index.html source code looking for 
  ways to simplify the code so there would be less code to convert.

* reformated the HTML4 source code made it easier to find 
  duplications & inline-styles to simplify & convert.

* finally the html5 code was simplified to remove duplications and a 
  CSS file was created to remove the inline-styles from the index.html page.



The deliverables will be:
* Description of the webpage

* HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)code

* CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) code

* Browser output generated by the HTML & CSS code



Went to a meetup at Type A Machines:
* learned that the founders of the company met at a meetup.

* learned from one of the founders, what really matters is what you can do, not the degrees you have.
